# ES-DE Android & Batocera/ROCKNIX XML files

Featured in [Russ's in-depth review of the Retroid Pocket 5](https://youtu.be/ZFTrwWQOe5Y?si=3ve_EAiV98eTC2I0&t=1096) , there are the xml files that I gave him (updated to latest changes of the android side).

## THESE FILES ARE PROVIDED AS-IS, IT IS NOT A PLUG AND PLAY SOLUTION

As explained in his video, he had to do a few workarounds to get it working and even then it wasn't perfect (namely, every standalone emulator doesn't seem to work with the whole thing), I may look into perfecting it on my end but note that there isn't any support provided for these files.
